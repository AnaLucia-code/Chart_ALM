  <p>The proportion of the student body at the State University of New York (SUNY) that identifies as Hispanic/Latino has grown over the past decade. This has happened at the same time that enrollment at SUNY has dropped, according to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, Enrollment has fallen 10% in the last decade. That’s significant for a public state university system.</p>

  <p>In comparison to private, non-profit universities in New York State, SUNY schools now serve a higher concentration of Latino students.</p>

  <p>Kristin Blagg is a research associate at the Urban Institute. She says depending on how you break down the data, you may see different enrollment patterns. “When we talk about higher ed, we can talk about lots of different types of cohorts. So often when we look at demographic data, we look at first-time full-time undergrad.”</p>

  <p>Advocates are pushing for more funding from Governor Cuomo for the SUNY system.</p>
